# cse210-ww-student-template
Hello my name is Van Taylor, I'm really excited to get started with programming in C#
This is something I'm adding in order to test using the control center. Things are going well! 

This repository contains the starter code for many different projects. They are arranged folders by week. There is also an an empty sandbox project that can be used to play around with any concept you would like.
